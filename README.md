# ItsRainingRaincoats

ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR) is a Kenyan charity that aims to build bridges of integration between migrant workers and residents of Kenya. This project is tended for the fulfillment of the academic requirements of the Software engineering Immersive programme from General Assembly, and ItsRainingRaincoats was used as the subject of the study. The contributors to this project are in no way, means or form related to ItsRainingRaincoats.

## Description

Part of IRR's activities includes the collection of donations from people in Kenya and the re-distribution of the items to migrant workers on request. The current state involves a labour-intensive and tedious process, with inefficient means of communication between the migrant workers, donors and volunteers.

The goal of this project is to create a platform on which all three parties can conduct their exchange. For migrant workers, this would mean having a means to put in a request for items, without language being a preventing factor. For donors, this would mean having a means to submit a request to IRR to donate items and to schedule a drop-off of said items. For volunteers, this would take the form of a management platform where they are able to view both types of requests and conduct the quality checks, approvals or rejections, and tracking for the requests.

Three different workflows have been identified, each relating to the specific user group. As of 27 Oct 2022, the basic requirements for the migrant worker and donor workflows have been completed.

## Feature List

1. **Language Select** _(Currently not implemented)_

   - Four option buttons for users to select
   - One option must be selected before the user can proceed
   - Page can be skipped if the user has previously logged in

2. **Login Page**

   - Both username and password inputs must be filled up before the `login` button is enabled

   - Users have the option to sign up for a new account from the login page

3. **Account Creation**

   - **User Group Selection**

     - Options for migrant workers, donors and volunteers
     - Selection of an option determines the account creation process for the user group

   - **Donor Account Creation**

     - Only consists of User Account Creation

   - **Migrant Worker Account Creation**

     - Split into User Account Creation and Migrant Worker Profile Creation

     - **User Account Creation**

       - Required fields are clearly labelled upon load
       - Front-end validation to ensure the correct password is submitted
       - Back-end validation to ensure the username has not been taken already

     - **Profile Creation**
       - Various input fields for the creation of the migrant worker's profile
       - Required fields are clearly labelled upon load
       - All required fields must be filled in before the users are able to proceed to the next page

4. **Home Page**

   - **Donate Home Page**
     - Options for donors to click on donate button to proceed with donation process
     - Selection of an option will bring up modals to thank and provide donation info

5. **Donation Request**

   - **Donate Donate dashboard**

     - Options for donors to click on item category to donate. The top 4 categories are dynamic and mapped through a dataset that can be modified based on requirement.
     - A clear card shows the items that are currently low in quantity and are in high demand. Sorted based on status. This card is also dynamic and mapped through a dataset that can be modified based on requirement. If an item has low quantity, the color changes accordingly during display.
     - An information icon that can be clicked to provide users with more information on what the status of items mean (through modal)

   - **Donate Location**

     - Users are directed to choose the location to donate their items to (NSEW) via a drop down option menu. Upon selection of area, this will filter volunteer data to the specific areas
     - Visual Maps with clickable location pins will appear for users to choose
     - Drop off information - Volunteer information will be filtered, mapped and displayed. This will include dynamic data such as available time and contact details.
     - All required fields must be selected before the users are able to proceed to the next page

   - **Donate Items Step 1**

     - Once the location and drop off details are confirmed, users will be directed to the donate items step 1 page where users will select a generic category of items they wish to donate (generic layer). This is displayed in a grid format and is dynamic and not hardcoded, allowing the team to change the categories more easily in the future. All required fields must be selected before the users are able to proceed to the next page.

   - **Donate Items Step 2**

     - Once the generic category has been chosen, users will now be directed to the second layer of selection to choose a more specific item to donate (detailed layer). This new category is filtered data based on Donate Items 1 selection, mapped and displayed accordingly in a grid format.
     - Upon selecting the detailed category, users will be directed to a new page (component) to select item details through onclick buttons which set the states for required body values that create backend data through POST method.

  - The `Proceed to Delivery` button will navigate to the Delivery Method page

- **Delivery Method**

  - Includes a summary of requested items and their wait times
  - Last page for users to delete items from their cart before checking out
  - Users can select either delivery or self-pickup
  - The `Next` button will navigate to the confirmation page

## Back-end (Server)

The backend repository used for this project can be found at [its-raining-raincoat-backend]( https://github.com/maybelline-ang/its-raining-raincoat-backend). The technologies used for the backend are: Node.js, Express, MongoDB & Atlas, Mongoose, UUID, and Bcrypt.

### Back-end Repository Structure

- `server.js` is the entry point to our application, it defines our express server
- `db/db.js` connects our application to our MongoDB Atlas database 
- `routes/` contains the route definitions for our API
- `controllers/` contains the controller definitions used in our routes
- `models/` contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models 

### Routes

There are 4 files in the `routes/` folder. Each file contains route definitions to Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) different aspects of the application.
- `donateItem.js` to CRUD donated items selected by the Donor persona. The controllers used are defined in `controllers/donateItem.js`
- `itemRequestRouter.js` to CRUD the requested items selected by the Worker persona. The controllers used are defined in `controllers/itemRequestController.js`
- `userRouter.js` to create and to login user accounts (includes both Worker and Donor persona). The controllers used are defined in `controllers/userController.js`
- `workerProfileRouter.js` to CRUD the accounts and profiles for the Worker persona. The controllers used are defined in `controllers/workerProfileController.js`

### Models

There are 4 models in the `models/` folder. Each file contains Mongoose schema definitions.
- `DonateItems.js` for creating a new donated item, with details filled in by the Donor persona
- `ItemRequest.js` for creating a new requested item, with details filled in by the Worker persona
- `Users.js` for creating a new user account (includes both Donor and Worker accounts)
- `WorkerProfiles.js` for creating a new worker profile, taking in details filled in when a worker creates an account

## Potential Future Implementations

- **Interactive Map for Donor Location Selection**
- **Photo Upload for Item Donations and Item Requests**
- **Volunteer Workflows**

## Issues Faced

- Many repeated components (code is not DRY)
- No standardised implementation of certain features
